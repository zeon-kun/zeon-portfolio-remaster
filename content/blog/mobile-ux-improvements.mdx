## The Feedback

A friend opened the portfolio on their phone and said two things:

1. **"The bottom bar has too many icons."** Eight items fighting for space in a ~375px bar. Each icon was tiny, the labels were unreadable, and the whole thing felt like a toolbar from 2008.
2. **"The globe is distracting on mobile."** On desktop, the wireframe sphere has room to breathe. On a phone screen, it competes with the actual content.

Both observations pointed to the same root problem: **what works at 1440px doesn't automatically work at 375px.**

## Bottom Nav: 5 Items + "More"

The original mobile bottom bar rendered every navigation target inline — 4 slide links, 2 route links (Blog, Changelog), and 2 social links (Email, GitHub). That's 8 touch targets in a single row.

The fix was straightforward: keep the 4 primary slide navigations visible, collapse everything else behind a **"More" button**.

### What Changed

The bottom bar now shows exactly 5 items:

| Slot | Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Home |
| 2 | About |
| 3 | Experience |
| 4 | Projects |
| 5 | More (...) |

Tapping "More" opens a popup anchored above the bottom bar with Blog, Changelog, Email, and GitHub listed vertically with proper labels. The popup closes on outside tap, re-tap, or navigation.

### Implementation Detail

The popup needed `z-[60]` to sit above the audio player (which shares `z-50` with the navbar). Without this, the play button would render on top of the popup — a classic stacking context issue when multiple fixed-position elements share the same z-index.

```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-full mb-2 right-0 z-[60]
  border border-foreground/10 bg-background/90 backdrop-blur-md">
  {/* Route links + social links */}
</div>
```

## Globe Toggle: User Control Over Decoration

Instead of auto-hiding the globe on scroll (which felt unpredictable), I added a **globe visibility toggle** to the navbar — both desktop and mobile. A small `Globe` icon that toggles the entire wireframe sphere and planetarium on or off.

### Why a Toggle Over Auto-Hide

The initial plan was to detect scroll activity and fade the globe out automatically, then fade it back after 1 second of inactivity. This had two problems:

1. **Unpredictable timing.** Users would see the globe flickering in and out during casual browsing.
2. **No user agency.** If someone finds the globe distracting, they want it gone — not gone-then-back-then-gone-again.

A toggle is explicit. Tap once to hide, tap again to show. The state lives in `globeState` (a plain object read by the canvas animation loop), so there's zero React re-render overhead.

### The Fade

The globe doesn't snap on/off — it lerps smoothly using the existing animation loop:

```javascript
// Inside the rAF draw loop
const visTarget = globeState.globeVisible ? 1.0 : 0.0;
visibilityScale += (visTarget - visibilityScale) * 0.08;
```

On mobile, the base opacity is already reduced to 40% (`mobileScale = 0.4 * visibilityScale`) so the globe stays subtle even when visible.

## Audio Player: Scroll-Aware on Mobile

The audio player sits fixed at `bottom-20 right-4` on mobile, just above the bottom nav. During active scrolling, it fades out and slides down to get out of the way, then fades back after 1 second of inactivity.

This uses the same `portfolio:scroll` custom event that the slide system dispatches on wheel and touch interactions — so it works on both the slide-based home page (where there's no native `window.scroll`) and standard scrolling pages like Blog and Changelog.

```tsx
// Check viewport at event time, not mount time
function onScroll() {
  if (window.innerWidth >= 768) return;
  setScrollHidden(true);
  clearTimeout(timer);
  timer = setTimeout(() => setScrollHidden(false), 1000);
}

window.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll, { passive: true });
window.addEventListener("portfolio:scroll", onScroll);
```

Desktop behavior is completely unchanged.

---

## Custom Scroll Events

The portfolio's home page doesn't use standard page scrolling — slides are positioned absolutely and transitioned with GSAP. This means `window.scroll` never fires on the home page.

To bridge the gap, the `SlideContainer` now dispatches a lightweight custom event on wheel and touch interactions:

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new Event("portfolio:scroll"));
```

Any component that needs to react to "the user is scrolling" can listen for both `scroll` and `portfolio:scroll` without caring about which navigation model is active.

---

## The Takeaway

Mobile UX isn't about shrinking the desktop layout. It's about **re-prioritizing**. The bottom nav didn't need 8 items — it needed the 4 that matter most, with a clear path to the rest. The globe didn't need algorithmic hide/show logic — it needed a button. Small changes, but they shift the experience from "desktop site on a small screen" to something that feels like it was designed for the device.
