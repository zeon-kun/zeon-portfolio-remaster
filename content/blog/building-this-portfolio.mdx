## Why Another Portfolio

Most developer portfolios feel the same — dark mode, gradient blobs, scroll animations. I wanted something that felt intentional. Something closer to architecture than web design.

The direction: **Japanese Brutalist**. Raw structure, visible grids, generous negative space (ma/間), kanji as visual weight, and a warm earthy palette instead of the usual dark-on-dark.

## The Globe

The centerpiece is a wireframe sphere rendered on a 2D canvas — no Three.js, no WebGL. Just `fillRect` calls for each point.

The sphere uses a Fibonacci spiral to distribute 900 points evenly. Latitude and longitude rings add wireframe structure. The whole thing rotates via manual Y/X axis rotation matrices applied per-point every frame.

```
function rotateYAxis(x, y, z, angle) {
  const cos = Math.cos(angle);
  const sin = Math.sin(angle);
  return [x * cos + z * sin, y, -x * sin + z * cos];
}
```

When audio is playing, the globe reacts to frequency bands — bass expands the radius, treble increases point sizes, and beat detection spawns ripple waves across the surface.

## Slide System

Instead of scroll-based sections, the portfolio uses a slide system with GSAP-powered transitions. Each slide occupies the full viewport. Navigation happens via keyboard arrows, mouse wheel (with a dwell-at-boundary pattern to prevent accidental slides), and touch swipes.

The globe smoothly lerps between positions per slide — large and centered for hero, small top-right for about, bottom-left for experience.

## What I Learned

- **Canvas performance matters.** 900 points at 60fps is fine, but adding per-point wave displacement calculations pushed it. Keeping the math simple (no `Math.pow`, minimal trig per point) was key.
- **Negative space is a feature, not a bug.** The hardest design decision was leaving things empty. Every instinct says "fill the gap." Resisting that made the design work.
- **Audio API is fragile.** Browser autoplay policies, suspended AudioContext states, and cross-origin restrictions all needed handling. The globe's audio reactivity only works after explicit user interaction.
