## Why Another Portfolio

Most developer portfolios feel interchangeable—dark mode, gradient blobs, and scroll-triggered fade-ins. I wanted something that felt intentional. Something closer to architecture than web design.

The direction: **Japanese Brutalist**. Raw structure, visible grids, generous negative space (**ma/間**), kanji as visual weight, and a warm, earthy palette instead of the usual dark-on-dark aesthetic.

## The Globe: 3D Math in a 2D World

The centerpiece is a wireframe sphere rendered on a 2D canvas. No Three.js. No WebGL. Just `fillRect` calls for each point to maintain a raw, low-fi aesthetic.

### The Mathematics

The sphere uses a **Fibonacci spiral** to distribute 900 points evenly across the surface. Latitude and longitude rings add structural wireframe lines. The entire system rotates via manual rotation matrices applied to every point, every frame.

```javascript
function rotateYAxis(x, y, z, angle) {
  const cos = Math.cos(angle);
  const sin = Math.sin(angle);
  return [x * cos + z * sin, y, -x * sin + z * cos];
}
```

### Audio Reactivity

When audio is playing, the globe responds to real-time frequency analysis:

- **Bass frequencies** expand the sphere's radius.
- **Treble frequencies** increase individual point sizes.
- **Beat detection** spawns ripple waves that propagate across the surface.

> **Note:** The `AudioContext` only initializes after explicit user interaction to comply with modern browser autoplay policies.

## Navigation: Slides, Not Scrolling

Instead of standard scroll-based sections, the portfolio uses a robust slide system with **GSAP-powered transitions**. Each slide occupies the full viewport, creating a "spatial" feel.

**Navigation Methods:**

- **Keyboard:** Arrow keys for precise jumping.
- **Mouse:** Wheel interaction with a "dwell-at-boundary" pattern to prevent accidental rapid-fire slides.
- **Touch:** Swipe gestures for mobile parity.

The globe smoothly interpolates (lerps) between positions for each slide—large and centered for the **Hero**, small and top-right for **About**, and bottom-left for **Experience**.

## Design System in Practice

### Color & Typography

The palette is intentionally muted. Background is a warm clay (`#f5f0eb`), foreground is a soft near-black (`#1a1a1a`), and the accent is a terracotta (`#a35b42`) reserved for active states.

| Element                | Typeface     | Style                      |
| :--------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------- |
| **Kanji Display**      | Noto Sans JP | 900 weight, Massive scale  |
| **Editorial Headings** | Geist        | 600 weight, Semi-bold      |
| **Structural Labels**  | Geist Mono   | Uppercase, tracking-widest |

### The Grid

A persistent architectural grid overlays every slide—vertical lines at 8%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 92% width; horizontal lines at 12%, 38%, 72%, and 88% height. These aren't decorative; they provide the structural rhythm that makes the negative space feel intentional rather than empty.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Canvas Performance:** 900 points at 60fps is manageable, but per-point wave displacement calculations pushed the limits. Minimizing trigonometry and avoiding expensive operations per point was essential.
2. **Embracing "Ma":** The hardest design decision was leaving gaps empty. Resisting the impulse to fill every space is what makes the design work.
3. **Fragile APIs:** The Web Audio API is temperamental. Browser policies and suspended states required defensive handling and graceful degradation.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Animation:** GSAP 3.14
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Typography:** Noto Sans JP, Geist Mono, Outfit
- **State:** React 19 Server Components
