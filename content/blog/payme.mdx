## Why a Payment Page

Most payment links are ugly. A Venmo profile, a raw crypto address in a DM, or "invoice on request." None of that felt right for a portfolio that cares about design.

The `支払い` page solves a specific problem: **getting paid without friction**, for two completely different contexts — local Indonesian bank transfers via QRIS, and international crypto payments via Ethereum mainnet.

---

## Two Methods, One Page

The layout is a two-column card grid on desktop, stacked on mobile:

| Method | Channel | Use Case |
| :----- | :------ | :------- |
| QRIS | All Indonesian banks + e-wallets | Local freelance, friends |
| Ethereum | Mainnet | International, crypto-native |

Both cards share the same visual language — thin `border-foreground/10` borders, micro-labels in Geist Mono, no decorative chrome that doesn't serve a function.

---

## Method 01: QRIS

QRIS (Quick Response Indonesian Standard) is a unified QR payment system adopted across every Indonesian bank and digital wallet. One code, every app.

### The Card

The QR code sits in a `border-2 border-dashed border-foreground/15` frame with corner marker overlays — a reference to the alignment corners printed on physical QR codes. Three actions sit below:

- **ZOOM** — Opens a full-viewport modal with the QR enlarged to 320×320px for easy scanning
- **SAVE QR** — Downloads `/qris.png` directly, so the payer can screenshot or print
- **SEND RECEIPT** — Opens a pre-composed `mailto:` link

### The Zoom Modal

The overlay uses `fixed inset-0 z-[100]` to sit above the navbar (`z-50`) and slide content (`z-10`), with `bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-md` for a focused feel:

```tsx
{expanded && (
  <div
    className="fixed inset-0 z-[100] flex items-center justify-center bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-md"
    onClick={() => setExpanded(false)}
  >
    {/* click outside → dismiss */}
  </div>
)}
```

Tapping outside collapses the modal. No close button required — the overlay itself is the target.

### Pre-Composed Receipt Email

The "SEND RECEIPT" button is a plain `<a href="mailto:...">` with a URL-encoded subject and body already written:

```
mailto:rafif.zeon@gmail.com
  ?subject=Payment Receipt — QRIS
  &body=Hi Rafif,\n\nHere is my payment receipt for the QRIS transfer.\n\n[Attach screenshot]\n\nRegards,\n[Your name]
```

The payer's email client opens with everything pre-filled — they attach their screenshot and send. Zero copy-pasting on their end.

---

## Method 02: Ethereum

The ETH card shows the Ethereum mainnet address alongside a minimal diamond SVG built from two `<polygon>` elements — the upper and lower halves of the classic ETH icon:

```svg
<polygon points="11,0 22,8 11,12 0,8" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="1.2" />
<polygon points="11,12 22,8 11,24 0,8" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="1.2" />
```

No external icon library. Two polygons, one icon.

### CopyAddress

The address interaction is a client component that manages clipboard state:

```tsx
async function copy() {
  await navigator.clipboard.writeText(address);
  setCopied(true);
  setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 2000);
}
```

The address is truncated in the display (`0x821E…1C64`) so the card doesn't overflow at narrow widths, but the clipboard always receives the full 42-character address. A check icon swaps in for 2 seconds as confirmation.

### Network Badge

A small dot + "Ethereum Mainnet" label below the card header is a gentle reminder to verify the network before sending. On a page this minimal, one line of text can prevent an expensive wrong-network mistake.

---

## Market Pulse at the Bottom

A `CryptoTicker` strip runs below the two cards, showing live prices for BTC, ETH, SOL, and the rest of the watchlist. The intent is practical — if someone is about to send ETH, they should be able to see the current rate without leaving the page.

```
BTC  $84,230  +1.2%   ETH  $2,411  -0.4%   SOL  $132  +3.1%  …
```

The ticker polls `/api/crypto` (a server-side CoinGecko proxy) every 60 seconds. Rate-limited responses show a `stale · retry in Xs` indicator instead of blanking — stale prices are more useful than nothing.

A "Full view →" link routes to `/market` for the complete watchlist with sparklines, market cap, and global market data.

## Design Details

The page uses the same Japanese Brutalist system as the rest of the portfolio:

- `支払い` as the `<h1>` — the kanji carries the semantic weight
- Vertical `支払` at the left edge in `writing-vertical text-foreground/10` — structural, not content
- Top-right annotation `支払い / Payment` in `text-[9px] font-mono` — the translation, quietly in the corner
- `force-static` export — no server-side data, no hydration overhead

The result is a page that feels like part of the same system, not a bolt-on afterthought.
